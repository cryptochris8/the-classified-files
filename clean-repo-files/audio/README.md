# Audio Files

To enhance the suspenseful atmosphere, audio files are organized in subdirectories:

## Music (background music)
Located in `music/` folder:
- `suspense.mp3` - Main background music (dark, atmospheric, investigative theme)

## Sound Effects (SFX)
Located in `sfx/` folder:
- `button-click.wav` - Sound effect for button clicks (IMPLEMENTED)
- `choice-click.mp3` - Alternative sound effect for button clicks
- `document-reveal.mp3` - Sound when new documents are revealed
- `typing.mp3` - Typewriter sound effect for text animation

## Recommended Sources:
- Free suspenseful music: YouTube Audio Library, Freesound.org, or Zapsplat
- Search terms: "dark ambient", "investigation music", "suspense thriller soundtrack"
- Ensure files are royalty-free or properly licensed

## Audio Settings:
- Format: MP3
- Quality: 128kbps minimum
- Volume: Background music should be subtle (30% volume)
- Loop: Background music should seamlessly loop

The game will function without audio files, but they greatly enhance the experience.
