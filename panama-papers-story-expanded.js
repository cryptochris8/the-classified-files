            APRIL 3, 2016 - SÜDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, MUNICH

            You are an investigative journalist who has received the largest data leak in history. An anonymous source calling themselves "John Doe" has given you 11.5 million documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.

            🔍 THE LEAK CONTAINS:
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            • 4.8 million emails
            • 3 million database files
            • 2.1 million PDFs
            • 1.2 million images
            • 320,000 text files
            • 2.6 terabytes of data
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            The documents reveal a global network of offshore shell companies used by world leaders, criminals, and celebrities to hide money and avoid taxes.

            🇷🇺 THE PUTIN NETWORK:

            💰 HOW DIRTY MONEY MOVES:
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            THE LAYERING PROCESS:
            1. Shell company created in secrecy jurisdiction
            2. Bank accounts opened in company name
            3. Money transferred through multiple entities
            4. Origin becomes impossible to trace
            5. Funds emerge as "legitimate" investments

            CRIMINAL CONNECTIONS FOUND:
            • Mexican drug cartel money through Panama companies
            • Russian mafia funds in British Virgin Islands
            • Sanctions evasion by Iran and North Korea
            • Bribery payments by multinational corporations

            KEY FINDING:
            Banks like HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse all facilitated these transactions despite "know your customer" requirements.

            The system isn't broken - it was designed this way.

            🌐 THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF SECRECY:
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            KEY SECRECY JURISDICTIONS:
            • Panama - 350,000+ shell companies
            • British Virgin Islands - More companies than people
            • Delaware, USA - 1 million+ entities
            • Switzerland - Bank secrecy tradition
            • Cayman Islands - $2 trillion in deposits

            HOW IT WORKS:
            1. Create company in secrecy jurisdiction
            2. Use nominee directors (paid stand-ins)
            3. Open bank account elsewhere
            4. Move money through layered structures
            5. True owner hidden behind corporate veil

            WHO ENABLES IT:
            • Law firms like Mossack Fonseca
            • Major banks worldwide
            • Accounting firms (Big Four involved)
            • Real estate agents
            • Art dealers

            This isn't illegal - it's how the system was designed.

            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

            HSBC:
            Helped clients evade taxes through Panama structures.
            Already fined $1.9 billion for money laundering (2012).

            DEUTSCHE BANK:
            Processed $10 billion in suspicious transactions.
            Linked to Russian money laundering.

            CREDIT SUISSE:
            Set up accounts for sanctioned individuals.
            Helped clients hide assets from US authorities.

            UBS:
            Operated nominee director services.
            Previously fined for tax evasion assistance.

            THE PATTERN:
            Banks pay fines as a "cost of doing business" while
            continuing practices that enable corruption and tax evasion.

            No senior banker has gone to prison.

            • Charged with money laundering in Panama
            • Cases ongoing in multiple countries
            • German prosecutors issue international arrest warrants

            • Offices closed in 40 countries
            • Clients scrambled to find new providers
            • (But the system continued with other firms)

            THE BIGGER PICTURE:
            Mossack Fonseca was replaced by other firms. The offshore

📄 LEGAL PROTECTIONS:
• Source confidentiality laws invoked
• Multiple jurisdictions provided legal cover
• No journalist has ever revealed source
• Even under government pressure

Mossack Fonseca clients include:
• Intelligence agencies
• Organized crime figures
• Authoritarian governments
• People who have killed for less

• HMRC task force created
• Crown Dependencies promised registers
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 RESULTS:
• £325+ million recovered by HMRC
• Multiple investigations opened
• Some prosecutions initiated
• Register created (though with gaps)

⚠️ LIMITATIONS:
• Crown Dependencies delayed compliance
• British Virgin Islands resisted
• London real estate still opaque
• "Scottish Limited Partnerships" loophole
• Enforcement remains weak

📄 ONGOING ISSUES:
• UK overseas territories remain havens
• Company House data quality poor
• Professional enablers rarely punished
• "London laundromat" concerns continue

Progress made, but UK remains part of the problem.`,

• Delaware - 1.5 million companies, minimal disclosure
• Nevada - No corporate income tax, privacy
• Wyoming - Anonymous LLCs
• South Dakota - Dynasty trusts forever

📊 BY THE NUMBERS:
• $4 trillion in foreign-held US securities
• Delaware has more companies than people
• South Dakota trusts tripled since 2011
• No federal beneficial ownership register (until 2024)

📄 THE IRONY:
• US pressures other countries on transparency
• While offering secrecy services domestically
• Foreign wealth flows to US havens
• "America First" in secrecy

⚖️ RECENT CHANGES:
Corporate Transparency Act (2024) requires beneficial ownership disclosure, but implementation is slow.

Panama Papers revealed how sanctions are evaded:

🚫 SANCTIONED ENTITIES FOUND:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• North Korean front companies
• Iranian businesses evading sanctions
• Syrian regime-linked entities
• Russian sanctioned individuals
• Venezuelan kleptocrats
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📄 HOW IT WORKS:
1. Create shell company in Panama
2. Use nominee directors to hide ownership
3. Open bank accounts in company name
4. Conduct transactions through layers
5. Real owner invisible to sanctions enforcers

🎯 EXAMPLES FOUND:
• North Korean arms dealers
• Syrian barrel bomb suppliers
• Russian oligarchs post-Crimea
• Iranian nuclear-linked entities

⚠️ THE PROBLEM:
Sanctions only work if ownership is visible. Offshore secrecy defeats sanctions enforcement.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Closing US secrecy jurisdictions
• Strengthening anti-money laundering
• Taxing offshore wealth
• Corporate transparency rules

• EU requires ownership registers
• UK register is public
• US finally passing requirements (2024)

⚠️ RESISTANCE:
• Offshore industry lobbies against reform
• Tax haven jurisdictions resist pressure
• Wealthy fund opposition campaigns
• Enablers protect their business model

Money flows globally but regulation is national. Closing loopholes requires international cooperation.
