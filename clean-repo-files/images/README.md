# Document Images

This directory contains visual representations of classified documents that appear during gameplay.

## Image Requirements:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 400x600 pixels (optimal for document viewer)
- Style: Should look like authentic classified/redacted documents

## Current Image Files Needed:
- `financial_doc.jpg` - Financial statement with redacted sections
- `handwritten_note.jpg` - Handwritten note on letterhead
- `flight_logs.jpg` - Private jet flight manifest
- `bank_transfer.jpg` - International wire transfer records
- `classified_memo.jpg` - Government memo with classification stamps

## Creating Document Images:
1. Use document templates with official-looking headers
2. Add classification stamps ("TOP SECRET", "CLASSIFIED", "CONFIDENTIAL")
3. Include realistic redaction bars (black rectangles over sensitive text)
4. Use typewriter or official government fonts
5. Add aging effects, stamps, or coffee stains for authenticity

## Image Sources:
- Create using photo editing software (GIMP, Photoshop)
- Use declassified document templates as reference
- Ensure all content is fictional and not based on real classified information

The game will display placeholder text if images are not present.
