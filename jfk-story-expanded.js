            DAY 1 - FRIDAY, 11:33 PM
            
You are investigative historian Dr. Elena Rodriguez, exhausted after a long day at the National Archives. The research facility is nearly empty - just security guards and the night shift custodial team remain.

Suddenly, the senior archivist approaches with a secure briefcase. "Dr. Rodriguez, this just arrived through classified channels. It's marked for your eyes only - something about your JFK research request from last month."

Inside: Previously unseen CIA, FBI, and Warren Commission documents that were supposed to remain classified until 2039. Your hands shake as you realize these files could rewrite American history.

The archivist whispers urgently, "Elena, I just got a call from someone claiming to be from the National Security Council. They know about the files. This could be the historical breakthrough you've been seeking... or it could destroy your career."

A handwritten note tucked between the documents reads: "The truth about November 22, 1963 was buried with the witnesses. Time is running out before these disappear forever. Start with the ballistics. -A Patriot"

Your secure phone rings. Unknown caller. You answer cautiously.

"Dr. Rodriguez? You don't know me, but I was there in Dallas. Those documents... they tell the real story. But powerful people will try to stop you. You have 48 hours before they invoke national security to seize everything. The American people deserve the truth."

The line goes dead.`,

🎯 BALLISTICS EVIDENCE - CLASSIFIED REVIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Location: Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas
Date: November 22, 1963, 12:30 PM
Weather: Clear, light wind from the southeast
Primary Location: Texas School Book Depository, 6th Floor
Distance to Target: 265 feet (final shot)
Rifle: Mannlicher-Carcano, bolt-action, 6.5mm
Total Shots Fired: 3 (Warren Commission conclusion)
Hit Ratio: 2 of 3 shots struck the President
Time Frame: 5.6 seconds (Zapruder film analysis)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your research assistant looks over your shoulder. "Dr. Rodriguez, look at this trajectory analysis. The angles don't match what the Commission claimed."

You notice handwritten notes in red ink: "Acoustic evidence suggests 4 shots, not 3. Grassy knoll trajectory confirmed by multiple witnesses."

Your secure phone buzzes. Encrypted text: "The single bullet theory was manufactured to fit a predetermined conclusion. Look deeper."

A classified memo tucked between pages reads: "Acoustic analysis suppressed from final report. National security implications if multiple shooters confirmed."

Your phone rings. The same mysterious voice: "You're getting close to the truth. The acoustic evidence was buried because it proved conspiracy. But be careful - others have tried to expose this."

After hours of analyzing classified documents, you compile your explosive findings. The evidence is overwhelming and undeniable.

📋 FINAL INVESTIGATION REPORT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CONCLUSION: Multiple Shooter Conspiracy Confirmed

Evidence Summary:
✓ Acoustic analysis proves 4 shots from 2 locations
✓ 78 witnesses reported shots from grassy knoll
✓ Medical evidence contradicts single bullet theory
✓ 18 key witnesses died under suspicious circumstances
✓ CIA operations files show active cover-up
✓ Warren Commission suppressed contradictory evidence

The assassination of President Kennedy was not the work of a lone gunman. Multiple shooters were involved in a coordinated conspiracy that was subsequently covered up by elements within the U.S. government for "national security" reasons.

            🕵️ FALSE DEFECTOR THEORY:
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            CIA "False Defector" Program:
            • Sent agents to USSR posing as defectors
            • Gather intelligence on Soviet methods
            • Assess KGB recruitment techniques
            • Report back upon return

            Oswald fits the profile:
            ✓ Military intelligence background
            ✓ Russian language training
            ✓ Easy exit from Marine Corps
            ✓ Funded trip to USSR
            ✓ Protected upon return
            ✓ No prosecution for defection

            🔫 CE 399 - THE MAGIC BULLET:
            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
            Official claim: One bullet caused seven wounds

            Alleged trajectory:
            1. Enter JFK's back
            2. Exit JFK's throat
            3. Enter Connally's back
            4. Exit Connally's chest
            5. Through Connally's wrist
            6. Into Connally's thigh
            7. Fall out onto stretcher (nearly pristine)

            Problems:
            • Bullet almost undamaged after 7 wounds
            • Trajectory requires "magic" path changes
            • More bullet fragments in Connally than missing from CE 399
            • Connally said he was hit by separate shot
            • Nellie Connally: "Two separate shots"

            • Gulf of Tonkin (1964): Full escalation
