# Audio Files

To enhance the suspenseful atmosphere, add the following audio files to this directory:

## Required Files:
- `suspense.mp3` - Main background music (dark, atmospheric, investigative theme)
- `choice-click.mp3` - Sound effect for button clicks
- `document-reveal.mp3` - Sound when new documents are revealed
- `typing.mp3` - Typewriter sound effect for text animation

## Recommended Sources:
- Free suspenseful music: YouTube Audio Library, Freesound.org, or Zapsplat
- Search terms: "dark ambient", "investigation music", "suspense thriller soundtrack"
- Ensure files are royalty-free or properly licensed

## Audio Settings:
- Format: MP3
- Quality: 128kbps minimum
- Volume: Background music should be subtle (30% volume)
- Loop: Background music should seamlessly loop

The game will function without audio files, but they greatly enhance the experience.
